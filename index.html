		<p>(11/1) Blockchain technology for mobile multi-robot systems: Giovanni Reina, Alexandre Pacheco, Heiko Hamann</p>
		<p>Abstract: 
Blockchain technology generates and maintains an immutable digital 
ledger that records transactions between agents interacting in a 
peer-to-peer network. Initially developed for financial transactions 
between human agents, the technology could also be used across a 
broader spectrum of applications, providing transparency, security and 
trust without the need for a central authority. In my seminar, I will 
discuss how blockchain technology can enhance mobile multi-robot 
systems. This enhancement includes ensuring that autonomous robotic 
agents adhere to applicable laws, are identifiable and accountable for 
their behaviour, are capable of identifying and neutralizing 
malfunctioning robots and can actively participate in economic 
transactions for the exchange of goods and services. Discussing the 
first applications, I will highlight the open challenges and describe 
the research directions that could reshape the mobile multi-robot 
research field in the coming decades.</p>

<p>(11/22) An updated perspective of the cortico-basal ganglia loop: Sabrina Drammis</p>
		<p>Abstract: 
Structures such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum receive projections from all or nearly all areas of cortex. Why does the brain have such an organization? Cortex is known to encode variables using a highly distributed code. Such a code can have great benefits like efficient storage, easy downstream decoding, inherent content addressable memory, and straightforward generalization, but there are also computations that are difficult to perform using a distributed code alone. Maybe the brain is organized in such a way that loops formed between the cortex and other brain areas compensate for specific limitations of the cortical code. In this talk I will propose a hypothesis for the computational role of the cortico-basal ganglia loop in flexibly resolving competition amongst cortical representations. More specifically, I will present a computational motif that I think could be implemented by the cortico-basal ganglia loop and ideas for a circuit level implementation. I hypothesize that the role of the basal ganglia is to direct affordance competition within the cortex, dependent on context; and the striatum (the input to the basal ganglia) transforms cortical representations into a form that are amenable to continual modification and comparison.</p>

<p>(12/13) Noisy Dynamical Systems Evolve 
Error-Correcting Codes and Modularity: journal club</p>
		<p>Abstract: 
Noise is a ubiquitous feature of the physical world. As a result, the first prerequisite of life is fault tolerance: maintaining integrity of state despite external bombardment. Recent experimental advances have revealed that biological systems achieve fault tolerance by implementing mathematically intricate error-correcting codes and by organizing in a modular fashion that physically separates functionally distinct subsystems. These elaborate structures represent a vanishing volume in the massive genetic configuration space. How is it possible that the primitive process of evolution, by which all biological systems evolved, achieved such unusual results? In this work, through experiments in Boolean networks, we show that the simultaneous presence of error correction and modularity in biological systems is no coincidence. Rather, it is a typical co-occurrence in noisy dynamic systems undergoing evolution. From this, we deduce the principle of error correction enhanced evolvability: systems possessing error-correcting codes are more effectively improved by evolution than those without..</p>
